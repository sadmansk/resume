    July 2019 - November 2020}
{ % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
\begin{cvitems}
\item{\textbf{Lead engineer} on Managed Certificate Renewal lifecycle feature and customer
    communications manager of ACM, leading feature development, managing 4+ engineers
    and orchestrating effort among 2 PMs, 2 sister teams \& 5 partner teams}
\item{Designed a \textbf{serverless canary infrastructure} capable of running
    long asynchronous workflows in parallel, providing metrics on service health and
    resilience using Lambda, Cloudformation, CloudWatch, DynamoDB, and EventBridge}
\item{Designed \& developed a distributed \textbf{job scheduling system} for asynchronous tasks to
    distribute system load, eliminating \textbf{100\%} of throttled capacity events on DynamoDB
    tables and other AWS dependencies, the primary scaling bottleneck to migrate off of relational databases}
\item{Worked with PMs \& partner teams across AWS orgs to identify \& eliminate high
    operational pain points for customers when importing 3rd party resources at scale,
    driving down \textbf{critical error rate to 0\%} and \textbf{p99 latency by 75\%}}
\item{Developed \& launched ACM as a self-service CloudFormation resource with full
    automation for customer certificates by coordinating with partner team in \textbf{20 regions}}
\item{Designed, developed \& deployed projects and automated operational tooling for
    DB migration from RDS to a hybrid data storage solution using DynamoDB, Elasticsearch,
    and Kinesis}
\item{Reduced fault rate of public APIs by \textbf{98\%}, driving down team operational
    load}
\item{Spearheaded a multi-team "Game day" by designing and simulating ~25 different failure
    scenarios to measure operational preparedness}
\item{Interviewed and mentored 10+ SDEs and Support Engineers for subject matter
    expertise accreditation}
